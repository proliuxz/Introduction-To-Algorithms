Initialization: before the loop start, (i=1) == true;
Maintenance: before the algorithm return a num or (i>A.length), it can keep running
Termination: if i>A.length, loop will stop.

Plus by bit:
C = A.length + 1
carry = 0
for i = 1 to A.length
    C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2  // remainder
    carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) / 2 // quotient
C[i] = carry
return C
